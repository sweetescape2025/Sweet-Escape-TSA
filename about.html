                    seventh
                    grader who goes to Lionville Middle School. Going into this project, I mostly worried about things
                    like
                    experience since I was not the best coder. But, together with my team, we were able to perservere
                    and finish
                    the project.</h2>

                    seventh
                    grader who goes to Lionville Middle School. I contributed a lot when it came to finding recipes
                    since
                    cooking is my thing. Although I did happened to struggle a lot with coding since it is one of my
                    weaknesses.

                    seventh
                    grader who goes to Lionville Middle School. I speciallized in html and was a great contributor to
                    the group.
                    Along with most of my peers I struggled in css and especially Java.

                    learn a
                    lot from Sai and Nihal.
